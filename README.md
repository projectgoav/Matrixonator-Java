Async Fork Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/projectgoav/Matrixonator-Java.svg?branch=AsyncDev)](https://travis-ci.org/projectgoav/Matrixonator-Java.svg?branch=AsyncDev)

A Java port of [The-Matrixonator](https://github.com/Sheepzez/The-Matrixonator) - A program written in Python designed to deal with mathematical matrices. This has already become a richer, better application than the original Matrixonator.

Currently uses JavaFX (a built-in to Java 8 GUI API that replaces AWT), and [ControlsFX](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) to provide features like Dialogs and Wizards that will be implemented in coming Java 8 updates.

Project tries to use Google Java style throughout.
